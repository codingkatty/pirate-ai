Gemini clone for pirates. Arr! ‚õµ<br>
The idea for this is by the 'dino', to suggest things for pirates, like a pirate assistant!

This is a website for the High Seas Hackathon. Here are some important links:
  - [Github Repo](https://github.com/codingkatty/pirate-ai)
  - [Website](https://codingkatty.github.io/pirate-ai/)
  - [Video Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6A9IJY-aGU)

## How to Use

1. After going in the website, you should see a prompt, click 'OK' to continue.
2. Then, select the textarea (input) and type your message.
3. After typing, click the 'Send' button. The AI shall then reply to you.

### Long wait after clicking 'Send'

I've used Render to host the webservice (python) to communicate with the API. If it hasn't been used for some time, the server will shut down, and it will take around 50 seconds to load. After that, it will load fast for future messages.

## Things I learned

For this project, I've used a couple of languages and services. I also explored how to implement AI in code. Despite knowing HTML/CSS/JS, I also learned and refreshed my knowledge during the making of this. It took me around 2 hours, with the help of Github Copilot for this project. I look to make more complex projects to improve me coding skills in the future!
